    <h1 class="newone">From the farmers to our consumers, our target is to make things easy for everyone! Our service brings comfort <br>to the customers as they can order vegetables/cereals and other farm product on whatsapp itself. It definitely saves their time and effort
        and this also ensures them fresh products. <br>Now coming to the another picture of our service (honestly the most important one) is the growth of farmers! Main reason behind to build this project was to eliminate the role of middle man and add
        marketing as a part of farming so that farmers can get the real value for their hardwork. <br>This will enhance the social and financial position of our farmers in our society. They can directly interact with their consumers, understand market,
        socialize and increase participation. Our project is not only what I have mentioned above.<br> These are just initial steps towards a better future. We do have bigger plans but for now this is something we can make at our level. So come with us
        together to make this bigger. Mark your presence!</h1>
